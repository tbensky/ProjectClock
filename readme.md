# Mechanical Clock Escapement

The following are step by step directions to cutting and building a working, gravity-driven mechanical clock escapement.

The escapement can be constructed using the parts shown here.

## Frame

To start, you'll have to CNC four parts out of wood.  We used wood planks that are about 0.8" thick, commonly used for shelving from our local hardware store. They come in 12' or 8' long planks, that are 12" or 8" wide. Again, the thickness is about 0.8".   The CAD (.DWG file) is in the CAD folder, and looks like this

Parts 1 and 2 are the sides of the escapement frame. Part 3 is the base of the frame, and Part 2 is the top of the frame.  The circles pointed to by the red arrows are to be CNCed as "pockets cuts" to 0.2730" (7 mm) deep. The
circles with the blue arrows are to be cut through.  The smaller (outer) circles on Parts 3 and 4 are countersinks for #6 screw heads and are cut 0.1" deep. The inner circles on Parts 3 and 4 are to be cut through.

We get good results using two tools.  All pockets cuts on Parts 1 and 2, and the countersinks and through-holes on Paers 3 and 4 are first cut with a 1/8" end mill. Some precision is needed on the pocket cuts to hold
the bearings snugly with just friction. Everything else can be done with a 1/4" end mill. Use tabs on all parts.

Our CNC simulation looks like this

We used a Shapeoko CNC from Carbide3D.
